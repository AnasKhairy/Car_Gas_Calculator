Hi there, 

Here you can find a straightforward explanation of the idea that led us to work on this project.
If you are planning to visit some places by the upcoming weekend and want to know how much it will cost, how much time it will take, or even the fuel consumption, then you are in the right place. 

By installing our app on your phone, you will be able to select what car type you are going to drive, the fuel type, and the places you will visit.
Our app is responsible for giving the time and fuel consumption for the root you entered from your end. But, by applying a custom algorithm to the app, it will give you also the best root to get the final destination.

Here you can find some screenshots of the runtime. We will keep it up-to-date as much as we can.

It was built using JAVA. There is another version of the same idea but using Flutter and Dart, we will add it soon.
